## Libraries and Frameworks
The main libraries and frameworks used in this project are:
- **ASP.NET Core:** ASP.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform web development framework. It provides a modular and flexible environment for building modern web applications. We use ASP.NET Core to develop the infrastructure of our login API, ensuring performance and scalability.
- **Entity Framework Core:** Entity Framework Core is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies data access and manipulation in relational databases. With Entity Framework Core, we can model and interact with the database efficiently, facilitating data operations in the login API.
- **Swagger:** We use Swagger to document the login API. It provides an interactive interface to explore and test the API endpoints.  
  You can access the interactive documentation using Swagger through the following link: [Swagger Login API](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).
